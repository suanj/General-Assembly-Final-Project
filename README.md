There are different ways that people enjoy music. More and more people listen to music using Spotify, Youtube, or Twitch. As a person who loves listening to music, I recently found interesting trends on youtube. Some people created youtube channels and post music playlists or music mix sets with eye-catching visual graphics suited to the music playlists.

Example of music playlist on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEwoWiKnZ5c&t=563s

Some of these music playlist youtube channels are owned by major music labels or companies to promote their artist's music. However, there are also a lot of youtube channels that individuals own.

So, I wanted to find a way to provide some insights and promote music playlist youtube channels to those individuals.
